**Chute It** has three main parts:

- Containers
- Assets
- Content

### Containers

Containers are discrete groups of content. Containers can have many various entries of content. The content can either be collected in an array or individually within the container.

### Assets

Assets are collections of individual pieces of content. Assets are part of a container.

### Content

Content is a file of a specific type:

- Text
- Image
- Audio
- Video

Other file types can be used but Chute It gives the above types more visual importance.

Content can also have custom **meta data** like `publish_date` or `publish_user`.

**Tags** are similar to meta data but can be used in hooks.
