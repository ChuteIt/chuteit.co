**Chute It**'s goal is to

- **Provide a framework that manages the content for all your projects**.
- **Make it easier for you to create with the content you own**.
- **Never take away your rights to the content you create**.

By using an S3 bucket, *you* retain *clear* ownership of your content. At any point, revoke access to **Chute It** if you feel your rights or privacy are infringed on by **Chute It**.

The projects built from the content managed by **Chute It** are always available from the S3 bucket and are, therefore, not affected if **Chute It** is disabled or down.

If you want to use **Chute It**'s power but don't want to bother with S3 at all, we have an option just for you. You data is obviously stored on **Chute It** servers but you still own your content. It just may be a little more difficult to access/export if you were to decide to leave **Chute It** one day.
